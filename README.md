# React Login Challenge

This project is a coding exercise for a junior React developer interview. It implements a login form with specific requirements and constraints. 

## Project Description

The login form is implemented in React and includes the following features:
- The login button triggers the `login()` function and passes the necessary data.
- The login button is disabled if the email is blank or the password is less than 6 characters.
- The login button is disabled while the login is being processed.
- An error message is displayed if the login attempt fails. The message is cleared with each new login attempt.
- An alert is shown if the login is successful.
